# not-lispy

A Lisp interpreter in Python. Many people have named similar repos as "LisPy" or `lis.py` since it's pretty clever. So this is called... not that.

This repo is intended only for learning and experimentation purposes at the moment. There will be missing features, mistakes and nonoptimal design patterns.

Everything will probably be loosely based on [Make a Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) and the excellent posts [here](https://norvig.com/lispy.html) and [here](https://norvig.com/lispy2.html).
